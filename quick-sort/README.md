# Quicksort

Quicksort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the Divide and Conquer strategy, partitioning the array into smaller subarrays, sorting them, and combining them to achieve the final sorted array.

## How it Works

The Quicksort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Partition: Select a pivot element from the array and partition the other elements into two subarrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
2. Recursion: Recursively apply the same process to the subarrays.
3. Combine: Combine the sorted subarrays to get the final sorted array.
