# Sliding Window

The Sliding Window algorithm is a technique for efficiently processing arrays or lists by maintaining a set of elements within a "window" that slides over the data.

## How it Works
The Sliding Window algorithm follows these general steps:

1. Initialization: Define the size and starting position of the window.
2. Processing: Process the elements within the current window.
3. Window Update: Slide the window to the next position, updating its contents accordingly.
4. Repeat: Continue the process until the end of the data is reached.
